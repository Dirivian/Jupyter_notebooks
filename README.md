### What is this repository for? ###

This repository houses my public Jupyter notebooks. The list includes topics like
* Application of limiter to numerical schemes for linear advection.
* Solving nonlinear hyperbolic Riemann problems using integral curves and Hugoniot loci.
* Low rank reconstruction of functions using singular value decomposition.
